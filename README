This is a plugin for Qmmp (1.0.0 or greater) which supports OptimFROG
files.

The OptimFROG SDK is required: http://www.losslessaudio.org/SDK.php.
Only version 1.500 (corresponding to OptimFROG 5.003) and later are
supported.

Qmmp plus development headers need to be installed.  Some vendors may
split Qmmp into two packages, with the development package being named
something like qmmp-devel or libqmmp-dev.  Qt5 development packages are
also required.

A C++11 compiler is required.  Modern releases of GCC and Clang work
fine.

To build, run Qt5's qmake (often installed as qmake-qt5), passing the
path to the SDK, and then build with make:

$ qmake-qt5
$ make

To install:

$ make install

This installs the plugin into Qmmp's input plugin directory.  To install
to a staging area, such as for packaging:

$ make install INSTALL_ROOT=/path/to/staging
